# LKExp-mbed-USB_receive_file

## Goal

Receive a file from USB serial communication

## Resources

[Mbed OS BufferedSerial class reference](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.2/mbed-os-api-doxy/classmbed_1_1_buffered_serial.html)

## Preparation

First, you need a script to send a file via USB serial communication. With Python on Linux, you have to import `serial` library, then create a serial communication with `'/dev/ttyACM0'`, and finally open a file you want to send in *read binary* mode (`'rb'`) and write its content in the serial communication.

In `main.cpp` (program of the DISCO board), create a class BufferedSerial, of which you will call the method `sync()` at the start of main function to flush the serial buffer. Then use the method `readable()` to wait for a file in the serial communication and to know when it is the end of transmission. Be careful though, **the flag returned by `readable()` is `TRUE` when a character is received in the serial buffer, but becomes `FALSE` once a character is read**. It means that if you read a character and check the flag of `readable()` too fast, the program will see that there is no other character and consider that transmission has ended. On the other hand, if you do several processes in the reading loop that takes a lot of time, you will not read fast enough and some characters will not be read.

To overcome this problem, just do the minimal amount of process in the reading loop and use a timer to allow some time for the next character to be received. Print the number of caracters received at the end to check if it corresponds to the size of the file that has been sent by PC.

⚠️ Note that `stdin`/`stdout` use the USB serial communication just like the class BufferedSerial. When you call standard I/O functions like `printf` or `scanf`, add a little delay before calling BufferedSerial read/write methods and inversely to avoid dysfunction.
