- [x] - print data at the right speed rate

### commands
- [x] - start
- [x] - stop
- [x] - change data rate
- [x] - change full scale
    * xl
    * gy

- [x] - print help
- [x] - select data to be printed


### not sure
- [ ] - print all (in case we just stock internally)
- [ ] - set data gathering duration
- [ ] - interrupts for data ready (could not make it work, maybe use semaphores)

### work better
- [ ] - ticker for printing data, instead of sleep_for
- [ ] - better data select (kinda bodged)


### clean code
- [ ] - make a command enum
- [ ] - transform in less cluttered functions
