# MLC documentation

This document is used as a "dump" of all the things we are learning about the MLC.
The idea is to keep the info extracted from the Datasheet and the Application note safe. We will be trying to put things in order as we advance in the project

#### Unanswered questions

* It seems the configuration of the MLC is reset or lost on power loss
* Decision trees memory slots have to be set up in order during the configuration, we don't seem to be able to add a given decision tree in a specific memory slot, also selecting a particular tree to change does not seem possible, all the MLC has to be configured again
* The UCF files appear to use the `PAGE_SEL (02h)` register to access other *advanced features* register pages than 0 and 1 which are the only ones documented.
  We don't know if there is a documentation for pages 2-15 but nothing is said in the LSM6DSOX datasheet/Application Note. UCF file makes references to registers in page 3 of the memory for example.
* UCF code seems to set up a lot of configuration registers, is it possible to change these configurations after the tree configuration or should they stay the same.
* Is there any reason for us not to use Unico until the UCF génération? The documentation suggests that the features would be directly calculated by the MLC, yet we can't access directly to the results of thoses operations by ourselves.
* Need information concerning sensors data rate compared to MLC data rate.

#### Software examples (from ST)
* Configuring the MLC : [link](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Standard_C_drivers/tree/master/lsm6dsox_STdC/example/lsm6dsox_mlc.c)
The _lsm6dsox_mlc.c_ file does a basic config of the MLC starting from a pre-made .h which consists on a _ucf_line_t_ variable extracted from a _.ucf_ file.

* Pre-made .ucf and .h : [link](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Machine_Learning_Core/tree/master/lsm6dsox)
These folders contain 6 pre-made configuration files as if you just got them from unico. .h files that you can directly put in you project are also given.

* Configuration example step by step : [link](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Machine_Learning_Core/tree/master/configuration_example)
Here you can find all the files from the data logs to the final _.ucf_ file, showing what each step of the pre-configuration process will give you 


## General info
* the MLC has 8 trees
* max 256 leaves (each leaf is a detected value)
* the trees do not have a defined size for what we know
* selecting a particular tree to change does not seem possible, all the MLC has to be written again

## Important info to be able to work ( To put on commentary to Ladislas )
(we maybe could find a better place for this)
* the INT1 pin on the LSM6DSOX has to be set at 0 at startup for the I2C not to be disabled. If the board hasn't a pull-down on that pin, you have to set it as a DigitalOut LOW (if you want to use INT1, set it as a DigitalInOut, output, low. Then once the sensor has started, disable I3C via its internal functions to force I2C and then set INT1 pin as input)

* The UCF configuration set up other things like the interrupts on INT1, and the data block update among other things

* After the device is powered up, it performs a 10 ms (maximum) boot procedure. During the boot time the registers are not accessible.

* INT2 signals can be redirected on INT1

* It seems the configuration of the trees is reset or lost on power loss

* Considering that the use of too many features may lead to overfitting, it is recommended to start by selecting the first four features:
    * Mean
    * Variance
    * Energy
    * Peak-to-peak

## Getting a ucf file from a data set (Not finished)
1. Collect the data
To get the ucf ( Unico Configuration File), you will need to use the Unico GUI software as well as a machine learning software like Weka that can generate a decision tree (There are others but weka is recommended). You can follow those video guides (5 videos) : [ST guide for LSM6DSOX MLC setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn92M_VSv0o)
The first step will be to get your movement recognition data set ready, for this you will need to record a correct amount of data corresponding to one movement.
_At this point it is worth noting that for more complicated movements, you will need to use the Finite State Machine fonction of the LSM6DSOX sensor in addition to the Machine Learning Core to differenciate between complex movements._
An important thing you need to know is if your board compatible directly with Unico, for example an ST test board connected to a compatible Nucleo board. In this case you can register your data set directly from Unico [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhcq0MMdGiY&t=1s). However if you're using a board that is not compatible with Unico, you will have to use Unico in "offline" mode, not communicating with the card. You will nevertheless be able to generate a ucf from a data set, but for the creation of your dataset, and furthermore a dataset compatible with Unico (CSV for example), you will have to do it yourself. We will however try to provide something able to register a data set if we can.
2. Start the configuration and create the arff file to use in a decision tree generator
When your different datasets each corresponding to a movement are recorded. You will need to go in the MLC tab of he Unico GUI : There you just have to add your differents data set and label them (for example with the name of the movement corresponding), it's quite intuitive. Once this is done, go in the configuration sub-tab and follow the different steps, selecting wich data features to use, if you want to use a filter, etc [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRvoH6jmiys). 
3. Create a decision tree from Weka
Once you created a arff file, you will need to switch to weka to generate the decision tree, following this : [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZEKBWfCyg4).
4. Finish the configuration with the decision tree
To finish with the ucf file creation, go back to the MLC configuration on Unico GUI and define your decision tree [video](https://youtu.be/yvoBt9zl5Ws).
5. (Mbed target) Change the the ucf file to a header file
The last step to be able to use the ucf file, which define what registers need to be written with which data, in an mbed implemented code, it to change a bit his format and make it into a header file that may be included in you code. This is possible using once again Unico GUI, on the main page in the "options" tab, select the button "C code generation" and select your ucf file.


## working with xl and gy
* xl or gy only needed if the features for the trees use them
* if used, xl or gy need to have a higher or equal ODR than the MLC
