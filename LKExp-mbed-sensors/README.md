## Construction

* Board set to [BSP\_DISCO\_F769NI](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/code/BSP_DISCO_F769NI/) (mbed) but can be changed to any ST board on mbed with Arduino shield connector.
* `DevI2C.h` come from [X\_NUCLEO\_COMMON](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/code/X_NUCLEO_COMMON/), it adapts i2c of mbed to i2c to manage i2c devices proposed by ST.
* `Component.h`, `GyroSensor.h`, `HumiditySensor.h`, `MagneticSensor.h`, `MotionSensor.h` and `TempSensor.h` come from [ST\_INTERFACES](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/code/ST_INTERFACES/) are abstract classes to build specific drivers.
