# LKExp - Mainboard - MZRobotic_Tests

This folder contains operational test code for components of the prototype mainboard.
Their aim is to test they are operational, **NOT** to test functionalities asked in specs.

‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER : This is a fast process, the first draft may have inappropriate terms and unsatisfying code architecture.

## List of components (and their main interface)

* Firmwares (QSPI)
* SD (SPI)
* SRAM
* Screen (DSI)
* Accelerometer & Gyroscope (I2C)
* Magnetometer (I2C)
* Temperature (I2C)
* Microphone (Analog)
* Light sensor (Analog)
* Motors (PWM)
* BLE (SPI)
* Wifi (USART)
* Bluetooth (UART)
* Speakers (Analog)

## Goals

* Firmware
	* Write, shutdown/reboot, Read. Written content must be the same on read.
* SD
	* Read existing (text) file in SD card.
* Screen & SRAM
	* Display image
* Accelerometer & Gyroscope
	* Get the ID.
	* Get (raw) data.
* Magnetometer
	* Get the ID.
	* Get (raw) data.
* Temperature
	* Get the ID.
	* Get (raw) data on a ramp of heat.
* Microphone
	* Get (raw) data on a ramp of sound.
* Light sensor
	* Get (raw) data on a ramp of light.
* Motors
	* Turn both motors
	* Ramp from one direction to another to maximale speed.
* BLE
	* Detect module on another device through bluetooth
* Wifi
	* Connect to a hotspot
* Bluetooth
	* Detect module on another device through bluetooth
* Speakers
    * Play one frequency e.g. 440Hz
	* Play frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz.
