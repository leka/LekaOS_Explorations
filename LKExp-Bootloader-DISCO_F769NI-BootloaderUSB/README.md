# LKExp-mbed-Bootloader_with_USB_app_reception

## Goal

From **LKExp-Bootloader-DISCO_F769NI-USB_receive_file** and **LKExp-Bootloader-DISCO_F769NI-Bootloader_with_IAP** as bases, receive a .bin file via USB and program the MCU with it

## Result

⚠️ File is successfully written in flash, but app does not run after bootloader (check if binary data has to be modified before being written in flash)
