### LSM6DSOX
To use LSM6DSOX on the STEVAL-MKI197V1 with X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2:

* [LSM6DSOX ST page](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm6dsox.html).
	* [LSM6DSOX datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm6dsox.pdf) to understand how it works.
	* [How to use the sensor on a DIL 24 socket](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/dm00628155-how-to-use-a-sensor-on-a-dil-24-socket-in-xcubemems1-package-applications-stmicroelectronics.pdf) (case of STEVAL-MKI197V1). Application note using LSM6DSO instead of LSM6DSOX but process could be similar.
* [STEVAL-MKI197V1 schematic](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/layouts_and_diagrams/schematic_pack/group0/d3/08/61/50/15/e4/46/7e/STEVAL-MKI197V1_SCHEMATIC/files/steval-mki197v1_schematic.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.steval-mki197v1_schematic.pdf) to identify pins from LSM6DSOX to X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2.

Plus understand how to configure hardware to set Mode 2 presented in LSM6DSOX datasheet.
